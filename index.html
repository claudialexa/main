            <h4>Small Business Owner</h4>
            <p class="lead">Typically, small business owners do not have the resources to invest in a traditional emergency messaging system, which leaves a large gap in their preparedness plans. When a flood happens, it can become difficult to get in contact with staff which can result in exposing employees to hazardous situations and losing valuable business. By creating a system that centralizes all communications in one easy, accessible and affordable app, BPrep helps small business owners minimize inefficiencies, save time and resources while keeping their employees safe and informed.</p>

BPrep cuts through the red tape and allows managers to set up a system plan within minutes with the tools they are already using to manage their employees.</p>
